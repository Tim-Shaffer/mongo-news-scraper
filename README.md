# mongo-news-scraper
A Full Stack application using the **MVC** design pattern.  

Scrape some current news articles from **The Philadelphia Inquirer** and store the Headline, Summary, Author, and Link in a MongoDB database.  Click the Links to view the full article on a separate page.  Save an article if you would like, and then add some comments.  Comments can be deleted from Saved Articles and Articles can be removed from the saved designation.  Clear any unsaved articles that do not have comments (Comments need to be deleted before the article can be cleared!) 

Check back occassionally to *Scrape New Articles!*
